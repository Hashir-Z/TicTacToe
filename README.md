# TicTacToe
This is a university project that I made, which includes:
1) A Loading Screen that changes color at run time, while also showing progress.

2) A Game Loaded Screen, which is needs working on. I cant seem to make a "press any key to continue" funtion while also retaining the color changing functionality of the code.

3) Choose A Character Screen, that asks user what character s/he would like to be. It also has proper error checking to ensure user cant enter any character other than an alphabet.

4) First Player Or Second Player Screen, that asks if user wants to go first or if bot should go first. It also has proper error checking to ensure user cant enter any value he/she is not supposed to enter!

5) User Input Screen, that asks user for input. It also has proper error checking to ensure user cant enter any value he/she is not supposed to enter!

6) A proper unbeatable bot, that uses the MiniMax algorithm to ensure it will never loose!

(i) Bot Calculation Screen:

7) An User/Bot Win/Draw Screen that tells who has won the game.

8) Play Again Screen that asks user if s/he wants to play again, and then executes the appropriate function.

9) and much more error checking to ensure the user isnt able to break the code!

# Notes:

1) There are a lot of Sleep events in the code to ensure user can see what is happening throughout the program. If you would like to increase/decrease the sleep timings, search for sleep and change the values accordingly.

2) The code is well documented, so refer to the comments in the program to understand what is going on.

3) I have given links to the sites that I used as a reference at the end of the file.

4) Go to the "SDTG" function and comment out/delete the "cout" to remove the "SIR DANISH THE GREAT" that appears at the top everytime. This was done to prove that the code was actually written by me.

If you find any error, feel free to fix it and upload the new updated file!
